            <p>End users will gain instant value from this site. The articles that will be showcased on this site will lead to knowledge and potentially financial gain. This website will serve as a platform to bounce ideas for future investments and push out content. This will also give users the abillity to connect with a group of investers and make money. In the future I want to find a way to have some sort of feed to show past investment and trade options/calls to show users real results but im not sure if I am capable of doing that as of now. </p>
